## Behavioral Questions
- Why Yelp?
    - I have three major reasons.

    - First and foremost, I love Yelp and its product. I believe Yelp has significantly changed how people do pretty much anything. It became essential to first search Yelp reviews before doing anything such as going out to eat, getting a haircut, and so on, which allows customers to make right choices and also gives incentives for businesses to find room for improvement and provide better services. Also, Yelp is constantly innovating and trying to better represent customers' demands such as recent EAT 24. I would love an opportunity to join a company that has huge impacts on people's lives.

    - Secondly, kind of similar to the reasons I've just mentioned, I have a lot of ideas and new potential features that Yelp could implement in the future that I would like to take a part in. I have had many ideas that align with Yelp's features that I wanted to build a start-up based off of, and I wish to grow as a software engineer at Yelp and hope to lead a team one day at Yelp to implement such features to make Yelp better and innovate how people interact using Yelp.

    - Lastly, I've talked to a few engineers from Yelp through meetups and my colleagues and I was told of great work culture at Yelp, which confirmed my passion to join the company. Also as I'm in a relatively earlier stage of my career, I believe Yelp offers great mixture of a big company with senior engineers to learn and absorb knowledge from but also start up culture where I could contribute a lot and build to make a real difference. I believe this is the best combination of environment to grow as a software engineer.

- Resume Overview
- Describe your previous projects

- What things do you care about the most for your first full-time job?
- What is something you'd like to work on if you were to work at Yelp?
- What would you change / improve upon if you were to redo your project?

- Yelp cultural fit - research this.
- Salary expectation
- Describe yourself in three words.
- How do you detect a spam-review using ML?
- What would be a new feature you'd like to add to Yelp?
  - Great with reviews but I think it would be also very cool to add "Trending places" based on age or area. To show what places are currently "hot" among similar age groups and serve trends in these. For example, for UC Berkeley, what are bars that are popular on certain days, which clubs to check out for students there. Also on to clothings. What can be leading the next trend? Yelp's immense data and users allow expansion.

## Longer question
**Interview Questions**
The problem:
I'm working on a collaborative code editor between 2 people. I have the text
synchronizing across both screens. However, I have run into the problem
illustrated below.

Example

Screen Person A Initially Screen Person B Initially
|Cat Ca|t

After pressing Enter on Screen1

Screen Person A After Screen Person B After
                                                  |
|Cat Cat

>>>Expecter Output<<<

Screen Person A After Screen Person B After

|Cat Ca|t

The content updates and the word cat shifts down a line. However, Person B's
cursor is left in it's original position instead of moving down a line as expected.

Implement the fixCursorRow method don't worry about updating the column.
*/

public class Cursor {
    public int column;
    public int row;

    public Cursor(int row, int column);
}

// diff comes from the other screen.
// content is content of the current screen before diff is applied.
// cursor is the cursor of the current screen.

// diff format:
// The diff contains all content from beginning to end of document.

{{"1", "\n"}, {"0", "cat"}}
// house -> horse = {{"0", "ho"}, {"-1", "u"}, {"1", "r"}, {"0", "se"}}
// "0" -> equality, "1" -> addition, "-1" -> removal
public Cursor fixCursorRow(String[][] diff, String content, Cursor cursor) {
}  


**Interview Questions**
Given two sparse Vectors, compute the Dot Product.
Input Format : The first line will contain two numbers(k and n), which are the number of entries for the two vectors respectively.
The next k lines are the entries for the first vector, of the form : x y
where x is the position and y is the value at that position in the vector.
The n lines are the entries of the second vector.
Any entries not specified indicate zero at that position.
The two vectors will always be of the same length

Example input:
3 3
1 4
4 2
5 3
1 7
2 6
5 1

Sample Answer: Dot Product = 4*7+3*1 = 31 (only print 31)

Vector v1 = new Vector();
