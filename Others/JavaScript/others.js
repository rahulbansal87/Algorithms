/**
 * Morse Code Translator
 *
 * Letters should be broken up with a space.
 * Feel free to use any process for differentiating the space between letters and words
 *     I recommend something like a / or | between words; ie 'DOG CAT' => '-.. --- --. / -.- .- -'
 *
 * Also feel free to modify this code or the HTML as much as needed.  You do not need to use this structure.
