# Concepts

### Scrum
- An Agile framework for completing complex projects
- Process
  - A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
  - During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
  - The team has a certain amount of time - a sprint (usually two to four weeks) - to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
  - Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
  - At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
  - The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
  - As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and beings working again

### OOP
- **Object-oriented programming** is a programming language model organized around objects rather than actions and data rather than logic.
- An **object** is a collection of data and functions. When you pass an object to another part of the program, that part of the program also gets the ability to perform operations on the object, great for user-defined types. (Encapsulation)
- **Shallow equality** (Do they point to exactly the same spot in memory, the same instance) vs. **Deep equality** (We get to define).
- **Data modeling**: identify all the objects the programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other.
- Allows inheritance, reducing development time, easier development experience, and more accurate coding and robustness with reusability. Also data hiding prevents instance of certain class from accidentally accessing other data - safe development. The encapsulation allows programmer to define the class with many functions and characteristics and only few functions are exposed to the user.

### Private vs. Protected
- Private data or method can only be accessed within the class.
- Protected can be accessed by this class and any subclasses of this class.
