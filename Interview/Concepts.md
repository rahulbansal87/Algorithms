# Concepts

## Scrum
- An Agile framework for completing complex projects
- Process
  - A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
  - During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
  - The team has a certain amount of time - a sprint (usually two to four weeks) - to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
  - Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
  - At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
  - The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
  - As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and beings working again
